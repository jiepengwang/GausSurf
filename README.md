# GausSurf: Geometry-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for Surface Reconstruction
In this paper, we present a new 3D Gaussian Surface based method, GausSurf, for efficient and high-quality multiview surface reconstruction with geometric gauidance (1) from patch-match and normal priors. For texture-rich areas, we utilize multi-view consistency constraints to guide the optimization process. For texture-less regions, we incorporate normal priors from a pretrained model to provide supplementary supervision signals. By effectively integrating these geometric priors, our method achieves both high-quality and efficient surface reconstruction.
